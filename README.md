## 📋 Overview

This repository provides a complete, automated infrastructure-as-code solution for hosting **Umami**, a privacy-focused, open-source web analytics platform, in Microsoft Azure.
Designed as a modern alternative to Google Analytics, this setup prioritizes data privacy, security, and full organizational control over analytics data.

The entire deployment is orchestrated using **Azure Bicep templates**, ensuring reproducible, maintainable, and scalable infrastructure provisioning.

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **🔧 Infrastructure as Code**: All resources defined using Azure Bicep for maintainable, version-controlled infrastructure
- **🐳 Containerized Deployment**: Umami runs on Azure App Service with Linux containers for optimal performance and scalability  
- **🔒 Network Security**: Isolated deployment using Azure Virtual Networks with private DNS and secure connectivity
- **🌐 Hybrid Connectivity**: Point-to-Site VPN Gateway with Azure AD authentication for secure on-premises access
- **🔍 DNS Resolution**: Azure DNS Private Resolver for seamless name resolution between on-premises and Azure resources
- **📊 Privacy-First Analytics**: Complete data ownership with GDPR-compliant analytics platform

This solution is perfect for organizations seeking enterprise-grade analytics without compromising on data privacy or control.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed and configured
- Active Azure subscription with appropriate permissions

### Deployment Steps

1. **Authenticate with Azure**

   ```pwsh
   az login
   ```

2. **Deploy the Infrastructure**

   ```pwsh
   az deployment sub create --location <your-azure-region> -f ./deployUmami.bicep -p ./parameters/local.bicepparam
   ```

   > Replace `<your-azure-region>` with your preferred Azure region (e.g., `swedencentral`)

3. **Resource Provisioning**

   The deployment automatically provisions:
   - Azure App Service with Linux container
   - PostgreSQL Flexible Server database
   - Virtual Network with private endpoints
   - Point-to-Site VPN Gateway with Azure AD authentication
   - DNS Private Resolver for hybrid name resolution
   - Supporting networking infrastructure

> ⚠️ **Environment Notice**: This configuration currently deploys a local/development environment. Production and staging environments will be supported in future releases.

## 🐳 Local Development with Docker Compose

For local development and testing, you can run Umami using Docker Compose. The Docker Compose configuration is based on the official Umami repository with minor modifications for increased reusability and flexibility.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and Docker Compose installed
- Git for cloning the repository

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Physer/umami-setup
   cd umami-setup
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:
   - Set database credentials
   - Configure application settings
   - Adjust any other environment-specific variables

3. **Start the services**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access Umami**

   Once started, Umami will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Stop the services**

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

## 🔐 VPN Connectivity

The infrastructure includes a Point-to-Site VPN Gateway that enables secure connectivity from on-premises machines to the Azure Virtual Network. This allows direct access to private resources and seamless integration with existing corporate networks.

### VPN Features

- **🔑 Azure AD Authentication**: Secure authentication using your organization's Azure Active Directory
- **🌐 OpenVPN Protocol**: Modern, secure VPN protocol with cross-platform client support
- **🔍 DNS Resolution**: Integrated DNS Private Resolver for seamless name resolution between on-premises and Azure
- **📱 Multi-Platform Support**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android devices

### Connecting to the VPN

1. **Download VPN Client Configuration**

   After deployment, download the VPN client configuration from the Azure portal:

   ```pwsh
   # Get the VPN client configuration URL
   az network vnet-gateway vpn-client generate --name <gateway-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --authentication-method EAPTLS
   ```

2. **Install VPN Client**

   - **Windows/macOS/Linux**: Use the Azure VPN Client or OpenVPN client
   - **Mobile**: Use the Azure VPN Client app from your device's app store

3. **Import Configuration**

   Import the downloaded configuration file into your VPN client and connect using your Azure AD credentials.

### DNS Configuration

The DNS Private Resolver automatically handles name resolution for:

- Azure private endpoints (PostgreSQL, App Service)
- On-premises resources (forwarded to your corporate DNS)
- Cross-network connectivity scenarios

> 💡 **Note**: VPN connectivity is particularly useful for development teams, database administration, and secure access to private Azure resources without exposing them to the public internet.
